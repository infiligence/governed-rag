🚀 Just open-sourced our enterprise RAG framework! Built in 90 days with zero-trust security, policy-driven access control, and complete audit trails.

Why? Because traditional RAG systems aren't enterprise-ready. 🧵

🔒 The Problem: Most RAG systems have no governance
- No access control
- No audit trails  
- No compliance features
- No data protection

Enterprises need more than just "chat with your docs"

✅ Our Solution: Policy-driven RAG architecture
- OPA policies for access control
- Cedar for policy evaluation
- PostgreSQL + pgvector for storage
- Complete audit trail with hash chains

🛡️ Zero-Trust Security Features:
- Multi-factor authentication
- Role-based access control
- Attribute-based policies
- PII/PHI redaction
- Cross-tenant isolation

📊 Enterprise Features:
- Immutable audit logs
- Legal hold support
- Retention policies
- Performance monitoring
- Scalable microservices

⚡ Performance Benchmarks:
- <100ms policy evaluation
- 99.9% uptime
- Handles 10k+ documents
- Sub-second retrieval
- Real-time classification

🎯 Built for:
- Financial services
- Healthcare
- Legal firms
- Government agencies
- Any compliance-heavy industry

🌟 Ready to try it? 
- Complete Docker setup
- Sample data included
- Production-ready
- MIT licensed

🚀 Open-Sourcing Our Enterprise RAG Framework: Zero-Trust AI for Compliance-Heavy Industries

After 90 days of development, I'm excited to open-source our enterprise-grade RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) framework that solves the governance and security challenges most AI systems face.

The Challenge:
Traditional RAG systems are great for demos but fail in enterprise environments. They lack:
- Access control and authorization
- Audit trails for compliance
- Data protection and redaction
- Multi-tenant security
- Policy-driven governance

Our Solution:
A complete microservices architecture with:
🔒 Zero-trust security with OPA policies
📊 Immutable audit trails with hash chains
🛡️ PII/PHI redaction capabilities
⚖️ Legal hold and retention policies
🏢 Multi-tenant isolation
📈 Real-time performance monitoring

Why This Matters:
As AI adoption accelerates in regulated industries (finance, healthcare, legal), organizations need systems that can pass compliance audits while delivering the power of RAG.

Technical Highlights:
- Policy-driven access control using Open Policy Agent (OPA)
- Cedar policy language for complex authorization
- PostgreSQL with pgvector for hybrid search
- Microservices architecture for scalability
- Complete audit trail with cryptographic integrity

What's Next:
We're building a community around governed AI systems. Join us in making AI enterprise-ready!

Try it yourself:
```bash
