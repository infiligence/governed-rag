### Title
**"Open-Sourcing Our Enterprise RAG Framework: Zero-Trust AI for Compliance-Heavy Industries"**

### Content
After 90 days of development, I'm excited to open-source our enterprise-grade RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) framework that solves the governance and security challenges most AI systems face.

**The Challenge:**
Traditional RAG systems are great for demos but fail in enterprise environments. They lack:
- Access control and authorization
- Audit trails for compliance
- Data protection and redaction
- Multi-tenant security
- Policy-driven governance

**Our Solution:**
A complete microservices architecture with:
🔒 Zero-trust security with OPA policies
📊 Immutable audit trails with hash chains
🛡️ PII/PHI redaction capabilities
⚖️ Legal hold and retention policies
🏢 Multi-tenant isolation
📈 Real-time performance monitoring

**Why This Matters:**
As AI adoption accelerates in regulated industries (finance, healthcare, legal), organizations need systems that can pass compliance audits while delivering the power of RAG.

**Technical Highlights:**
- Policy-driven access control using Open Policy Agent (OPA)
- Cedar policy language for complex authorization
- PostgreSQL with pgvector for hybrid search
- Microservices architecture for scalability
- Complete audit trail with cryptographic integrity

**What's Next:**
We're building a community around governed AI systems. Join us in making AI enterprise-ready!

**Try it yourself:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/infiligence/governed-rag
cd governed-rag
make up
make seed
make demo
```
