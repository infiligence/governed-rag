# Document Chunking Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the chunking strategy for the governed RAG system, focusing on maintaining semantic coherence while respecting security boundaries.

## Chunking Parameters

### Size Guidelines
- **Target Size**: 500-800 characters per chunk
- **Overlap**: 50-100 characters between chunks
- **Min Size**: 200 characters (merge with adjacent if smaller)
- **Max Size**: 1000 characters (split if larger)

### Boundary Preservation
- Respect sentence boundaries when possible
- Preserve paragraph structure
- Maintain table/form structure integrity
- Keep list items together

## Security Considerations

### Label Propagation
- Each chunk inherits the document's classification label
- Labels are enforced at the chunk level for fine-grained access control
- Chunks cannot have lower classification than their parent document

### Tenant Isolation
- Chunks maintain tenant association
- Cross-tenant contamination is prevented at the database level
- Source boundaries are preserved in chunk metadata

## Implementation Details

### Chunking Algorithm
1. **Preprocessing**: Clean and normalize text
2. **Sentence Splitting**: Use NLP libraries for accurate sentence detection
3. **Size Optimization**: Merge/split based on target size
4. **Overlap Addition**: Add context overlap between chunks
5. **Metadata Assignment**: Assign labels, tenant, and source info

### Embedding Generation
- Generate embeddings for each chunk using consistent model
- Store embeddings as 768-dimensional vectors
- Use cosine similarity for retrieval

### Indexing Strategy
- Create vector index for similarity search
- Add metadata indexes for filtering
- Implement composite indexes for complex queries

## Quality Assurance

### Chunk Validation
- Verify semantic coherence
- Check size constraints
- Validate label assignment
- Ensure tenant isolation

### Testing Approach
- Unit tests for chunking functions
- Integration tests with sample documents
- Performance tests with large documents
- Security tests for boundary enforcement
